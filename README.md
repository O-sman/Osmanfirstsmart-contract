                              STEPS I TOOK IN SETTING UP THE DEVEPLOMENT ENVIROMENT

1.Installed metamask extension Browswer, created a new wallet get done with all the neccessary setups with wallet account stored and my seed phrase safely.

2.Access to REMIX IDE official website on my browser and created a workspace named Myfirstsmartcontract.

3.Created a new file name simplystorage.sol inside the workspace i first created named myfirstsmartcontract.

                               HOW I WROTE THE CODE,COMPILED AND DEPLOY MY SMART CONTRACT
                    
1.I wrote // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT in line one to obatian license which is not composury it is Optional.

2.I difine the version of my solidity compalier which is done by the Pragma directive it specifies the version of solidity that my contract can compalir with

prgama solidity ^0.8.26.

3.i wrote my code in the SimpleStorage.sol  after written my code i move to the compiler tool on on the solidity enviroment click on compiler to check for error or bugs.

next is to the Deploy tool to finally deploy my first smart contract.

                                    CHALLENGES I FACED AND HOW I RESOLVED THEM
                                   
 1. firt challenge was not specifiying the version of the solidity in the sol.file so the compilr is not able to compiler it and prompt error in line 2 of my code, 
    Resolved,i used the Ask Ai tchnology which is  integreted in the solidity evniroment to assist or Giude 
              
 2. Second Challenge was not able to connect my Github remotely on olidity,
    Resloved i rewatch the  vidoe of the Hackerboost Classrom of addressing questions and challenges of how the facilitor address connecting github on solidity challage 
            .
 3.third challehnge  How to push my project on githuh
